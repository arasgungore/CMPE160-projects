# Project 2: Ships and Ports

This project was assigned for the Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (CMPE 160) course in the Spring 2021 semester.



## Description

Hi, there. Welcome to the second project where you will be learning
the fundamentals of OOP. In this project, you are required to
implement a simulation of a port management system. The main objective
is to analyze the requests provided in input and carry out the
necessary actions.

There are ports, and ships are sailing between them. Ships are
carrying the following types of containers: basic, heavy,
refrigerated, liquid, and each of them should be handled differently.
Containers in a port can be loaded to ships, and, conversely, they can
be unloaded from a ship to port. Ships need a certain amount of fuel
to sail from one port to another.

Note that there is no user interaction during the execution, the
program parses the input file composed of sequential operations.

Also, as a significant remark, the signature of the methods and the
field names that you are going to implement should be identical to the
ones that are specified in this document. If a specific method
signature is not enforced by the project description, you can feel
free to implement it in your way (i.e. you can implement extra methods
considering your own design choice). However, you should also consider
the proper usage of access modifiers for preserving the desired
visibility and accessibility throughout the project. In other words,
you should not define everything as “public”, which results in a
penalty if done so.



## Class Hierarchy and Details

You are already provided with the following interfaces:
```
● IShip.java
● IPort.java
```

Do not modify the code in these files! You are responsible for all the
compilation errors that originated from the changes made in any of
these classes, including the addition or removal of libraries.

In addition, you are given a part of the Main class. You are required
to complete the Main class with the instructions given later in this
document. The other files are just empty. Using the fundamentals of
the object-oriented programming methodology and the inheritance
principles, you are expected to fill in these files in a suitable
manner to complete the project. Do not forget that you are free to
create new packages, classes, or interfaces. However, the class names
and properties that are given below should be exactly the same in your
projects. Please note that, if you fail to follow this instruction,
you do not get any points as your projects will be automatically
graded.

Before CMPE 160, there was a single source file and all the functions
were implemented in that file. However, in this project, there will be
multiple classes that interact with each other during execution.
Therefore, before starting the implementation, you are advised to
allocate some time to understand the main logic behind the design and
the relation among the code pieces.

Within the scope of this project, you are expected to implement these
classes (which will be explained in detail in the rest of this
document):

```
1. Main.java
2. Port.java
3. Ship.java
4. Container.java
5. BasicContainer.java
6. HeavyContainer.java
7. RefrigeratedContainer.java
8. LiquidContainer.java
```


### Main.java

The main method simply reads an input file that is composed of
sequential commands related to the operations. You can use this class
to test your code. Scanners for input and output files and the array
lists defined below are given for you.

You are required to read from an input file and print to an output
file, names of which are passed to your program as arguments. Apart
from unit tests to test your code and class structure, we will use the
Main class to test your code for various inputs and outputs.


### Port.java

Port class should have the following variables, exactly named as
below:

```
● int ID
● double X
● double Y
● ArrayList<Container> containers
● ArrayList<Ship> history : keeps track of every ship that has
visited
● ArrayList<Ship> current : keeps track of the ships currently here
```

Port must implement the IPort interface and the methods it requires.
The class should have the following methods, exactly as named below:

```
● A constructor with three parameters, ID, X, and Y.
● A method that calculates the distance between the object itself
and another Port, double getDistance(Port other)
```

Additionally, the choice of defining the variables as private,
protected, or public may require additional getter and setter methods.
This applies to all other classes as well, unless specified otherwise.


### Ship.java

Ship class should have the following variables, exactly named as
below:

```
● int ID
● double fuel
● Port currentPort
```

Ship must implement the IShip interface and the methods it requires.
The class should have the following methods, exactly as named below:

```
● public Ship(int ID, Port p, int totalWeightCapacity, int
maxNumberOfAllContainers, int maxNumberOfHeavyContainers, int
maxNumberOfRefrigeratedContainers, int
maxNumberOfLiquidContainers, double fuelConsumptionPerKM)
● ArrayList<Container> getCurrentContainers() : should return the
list of all containers currently in the ship sorted by ID.
```


### Container.java

Container is an abstract class and should have the following fields:

```
● int ID
● int weight
```

It should have the following methods:

```
● A constructor with parameters ID, weight
● double consumption() : should return fuel consumption required by
the container
● boolean equals(Container other) : check type, ID, and weight of a
container. If they are the same, return true; otherwise, return
false.
```


### BasicContainer.java and HeavyContainer.java

They should extend the Container class. They should have a constructor
with two inputs like a Container.

● Weight of a BasicContainer <= 3000
● Weight of a HeavyContainer : otherwise

Fuel consumption is as follows:
● BasicContainer : 2.50 per unit of weight
● HeavyContainer : 3.00 per unit of weight


### RefrigeratedContainer.java and LiquidContainer.java

They are special types of HeavyContainer and should extend the
HeavyContainer class. They should have a constructor with two inputs
like a HeavyContainer.

Fuel consumption is as follows:
● RefrigeratedContainer : 5.00 per unit of weight
● LiquidContainer : 4.00 per unit of weight


## Interface Details

### IPort.java

You are already provided with this interface. Do not modify the code
in this file! It contains the following method:

```
● void incomingShip(Ship s) : should add this ship to current
ArrayList.
● void outgoingShip(Ship s) : should add this ship to history
ArrayList.
```

Note that there _should not be any duplicates_ in the _current_ and _history_
ArrayLists _(i.e. do not add the same ship to history if it has already
visited that port before)_

### IShip.java

You are already provided with this interface. Do not modify the code
in this file! It contains the following method:

```
● boolean sailTo(Port p) : returns true if a ship successfully
sailed to the destination port
● void reFuel(double newFuel) : adds fuel to a ship
● boolean load(Container cont) : returns true if a container was
successfully loaded to a ship
● boolean unLoad(Container cont) : returns true if a container was
successfully unloaded from a ship
```


## Input/Output

### Input

In the first line, there is a number N, which represents the total
number of events that occur during the simulation.

In the following N lines, the actions are specified in their
customized format as described below. In other words, each distinct
line represents an event with a specific action in the port management
system. Please note that the test cases will not cover any erroneous
input regarding the format.

The possible actions are encoded through separate numbers:

```
1. Creating a container
2. Creating a ship
3. Creating a port
4. Loading a container to a ship
5. Unloading a container from a ship
6. Ship sails to another port
7. Ship is refueled
```

1. When creating a container, three or four inputs are given
depending on the type of container. The first input represents
the id of the port where that container should be placed
initially. Note that there _will not be_ a test case where a port
of that id has not been created yet. The next input is a _non-zero_
_positive_ integer, denoting the weight of that container.
    
Depending on the weight you need to decide the type of container:
● Weight <= 3000 : BasicContainer
● Otherwise: HeavyContainer
    
The special type of _heavy container_ is given as “R” or “L” , which
stand for Refrigerated and Liquid, respectively. There may or may
not be an “R” or “L” after weight. _It is important to note that_
_Refrigerated and Liquid Containers are special types of_
_HeavyContainer, meaning that input lines that contain “R” or “L”_
_should always create the respective type of container regardless_
_of the weight._ The ID of a container is determined by the
simulation and should be unique to each container. _In other_
_words, no two containers can have the same ID, even if one of them_
_is a basic one and the other a heavy/refrigerated/liquid one._
Successive numbers should be assigned as IDs according to the
order of adding them to the simulation by starting indexing from
0, such that the first container must have the ID 0 and the
second 1 and so on.

2. When creating a ship six _positive integers_ are given:
● The ID of the port where the ship initially is
● Maximum weight of all containers in that ship _(nonzero)_
● Maximum number of all containers in that ship
_(counting all types of containers) (maybe zero)_
● Maximum number of heavy containers in that ship
_(counting refrigerated and liquid containers) (maybe zero)_
● Maximum number of refrigerated containers in that ship _(maybe zero)_
● Maximum number of liquid containers in that ship _(maybe zero)_

A nonzero positive double is the 7th input denoting the fuel
consumption per km of that ship.

3. When creating a port, two _double_ inputs are given, which are the
x and y coordinates of the port. The IDs of the ports are also
determined by the simulation.

4. When loading a container into a ship, IDs of ship and container
are given. A container with that ID will always exist but may or
may not be in the port where the ship currently is. Ship with the
given ID will always exist. If the container is currently in the
port, it may or may not be loaded into the ship depending on the
restrictions of that ship.

5. When unloading a container from a ship, IDs of ship and container
are given. A container with that ID will always exist but may or
may not be on the ship. Ship with the given ID will always exist.
If a container with the given ID exists in a ship, it will be
placed into the storage of the port where the ship currently is.

6. When ships travel from one port to another, IDs of the ship and
destination port are given. Fuel consumption of the ship consists
of the value that was given in the creation stage and consumption
of containers. We will provide more information about how fuel
consumption is calculated in the following sections. In short, if
a ship has enough fuel it will sail to the destination port.

7. When fuel is added to a ship, the ID of the ship and the amount of
fuel is given. The fuel amount is a _nonzero positive double_.


### Output

You must print the ships in the ports list in the main class with
their attributes. Please note that the double values should have 2
digits after the fraction point. The output format should be ordered
in ascending order of the port IDs, while in each port, the ships
should be also ordered according to their IDs. A port should be
printed as “Port ID: (x, y)”, followed by IDs of containers located in
the port: “{BasicContainer, HeavyContainer, RefrigeratedContainer,
LiquidContainer}: [IDLIST]”. You should also list all ships located in
that port as “Ship ID: FUEL_LEFT”. Additionally, containers in each
ship should be listed too. Please, refer to example output for a
better understanding of output format. Note that port and ship
contents are indented with 2 whitespaces. Order of containers types
matter and should be as follows: Basic, Heavy, Refrigerated, Liquid.
